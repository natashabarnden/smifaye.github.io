    <h2>IWA rebrand</h2>
    <h3>Representing 6,500 miles of Britain's rivers and canals</h3>
    <p>Founded in 1946, the Inland Waterways Association has worked non-stop to protect and restore the country’s 6,500 miles of canals and rivers. Comprised of a huge variety of sub-organisations, members and volunteers, IWA needed a strong, consistent brand to unify people behind their cause. Equally, it was essential that the new brand do justice to the contrasts and diversity within the organisation.</p>
   <img width="100%" src="/images/IWA-logo-visual.jpg">  
      <p>Our brief was to conduct a thorough brand review, creating a solid foundation for the brand strategy to build upon, and from this craft a comprehensive visual identity.</p>
      <img width="100%" src="/images/IWA-Branding-Process.jpg">
      <h3>Setting the course</h3>
    <p>When creating a visual identity for IWA, we wanted to ensure that the diverse world of the waterways was represented; the joy of life and leisure upon the water; the human ingenuity and hard graft involved in creating and maintaining them; the wonderful range of wildlife they support. And at the core of all this, the members and volunteers that are the force driving the action. Therefore, we opted for a boat’s propeller to symbolise the momentum, driven by a central core to represent the heart that drives everything.</p>

<p>As well as featuring in the logo, the trio of patterns, which we developed to represent three core sides of IWA, form a central part of the brand look-and-feel – adding instant recognisability to all collateral. The blue wave, green leaf and red brickwork can both work together or stand alone, to create a flexible and instantly recognisable brand look-and-feel.</p>

       <h3> Results </h3>
    <p>The result was a bold and unique brand that IWA can stand proudly behind.</p>
      <h3> "Hatched brought a collaborative approach and intelligent, creative thinking to our rebrand project. They spent a lot of time getting to know the nuances of our charity and created a brand that resonates with our members and brought our sub-brands under one umbrella.</h3>
