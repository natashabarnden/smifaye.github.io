    <h2>UPP Wellbeing - Safety</h2>
          <h3>Starting a conversation about safety</h3>

    <p>UPP came to us with a challenge: make health and safety engaging. We needed to inspire and captivate, not scare and reprimand.</p>
       <p>Since UPP are a university accommodation provider with 30,000 students and 700 employees under their care, it’s easy to imagine how important safety is to all they do. After working in partnership with UPP for four years, with work including a full rebrand and website build, they came to us with a challenge: make health and safety engaging. Our brief was to create a fresh and inspiring brand and campaign to promote greater engagement with wellbeing in the workplace.</p>
      
<h3>Our safety, in our hands</h3>
    <p>The new initiative focused on positive behaviour, not rules and regulations (which everyone agreed they had got plenty of), so we knew this should be a human-focused campaign. We used hands to represent community and teamwork; to remind us that it’s the practical day-to-day tasks – everything we do with our hands – that comprise safety at work. </p>
     <img width="100%" src="/images/UPP-WB-Safety-Logo.jpg"> 
      
    <p>We worked with the illustrator Damien Weighill to create a suite of lively characters working in jobs where their lives were very obviously at stake. This grabbed attention and highlighted the fact that even though the jobs at UPP weren’t as infamously risky as flying to the moon, people’s lives are still on the line – whether it’s the contractors on construction sites or the students in their halls.</p>
    <p>The overall look and feel was a departure from UPP’s corporate branding, a decision we made to highlight how different the campaign was from what had come before and make it strikingly obvious that the company was taking a bold new direction with its approach to wellbeing.</p>

     <h3>Creating the tools for real change</h3>
      <p>The campaign was launched nation-wide with Director-led presentations. Employees were given an interactive workbook and cards to fill out near misses and positive feedback on - all in a bright, branded tote bag.</p>

       <h3>Year-round engagement</h3>
      <p>To ensure that the great intentions set out in the campaign launch were carried through the year and translated into real action, we created seasonal posters as well as a number of interactive workbooks and materials to keep the conversation going forwards and the number of workplace accidents going down.</p>

<p>The reactive seasonal posters were created in response to data gathered on the types of accidents happening in the workplace. For instance, when cleaners were getting numerous cuts on their hands due to students leaving shark objects in their sinks, we created a lighthearted poster featuring a sharks and a bottle-wielding octopus to make people consider what dangers could be beneath the surface.</p>

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>The success of the campaign became evident not only in the overwhelmingly positive reaction across UPP's workforce, but also in the safety figures for the year of the launch.</p>

<p>People were talking about safety and the light-hearted look-and-feel of the campaign helped build a no-blame culture where near misses could be reported and positive behaviour was rewarded.</p>
      
<h3> "I have been highly impressed by the creativity, passion and ‘can do’ attitude of the entire Hatched team."</h3>
