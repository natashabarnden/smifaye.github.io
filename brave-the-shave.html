    <h2>Macmillan - Brave the Shave campaign</h2>
    <p>Since its launch in 2015, Brave the Shave has raised over £16.8 million for Macmillan Cancer Support. With thousands of people braving the shave last year, 89% of whom had a close friend or family member with a cancer diagnosis, Macmillan were looking to take what is already a hugely successful ask and create a fresh and engaging campaign to spread the word even further.</p>
    <p>After working on a successful pitch, we have been worked closely with the Macmillan team and a research agency to fine-tune our ‘motivations’ concept to resonate with the core audience.</p>
    <p>My role in this project has included devising new, more direct, copy, working within Macmillan’s brand guidelines to create a print and online campaign to spread the word about Brave the Shave, as well as concepting and designing a welcome pack and t-shirt that will kick off peoples’ Brave the Shave journey. </p>
    <p>Working with my creative director and a copy-writer, I led up the design of all Brave the Shave materials, as well as art directing photoshoots of people braving the shave.</p>
