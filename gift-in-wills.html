    <h2>Macmillan - Gift in wills campaign</h2>
    <p>After the success we had working with Macmillan on their Brave the Shave campaign, we were delighted to have the opportunity to work with them again on a TV advert broadcasting on channels ranging from SKY to ITV and Channel 4, as well as a print campaign to feature in 17 national publications.</p>
    <p>With gifts left in people’s wills accounting for one third of their annual income, creating a meaningful and engaging campaign that would connect with the audience was essential to the continued work that Macmillan does to support those living with cancer.</p>
    <p>Working from the proposition of ‘life after life’, we focused on showing a view of people affected by cancer living their lives the way they want to – made possible by gifts in wills left to Macmillan.</p>
    <p>Motifs of the wider picture, connections and that of times where older generations are passing down knowledge to younger ones combine to show that by leaving a gift to Macmillan in your will, you are becoming part of a wider human tapestry and affecting lives far into the future.</p>
