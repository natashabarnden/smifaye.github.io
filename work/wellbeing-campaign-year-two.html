    <h2>UPP Wellbeing - Health</h2>
      <h3> Focusing on health</h3>
    <p>After the success of our award-winning campaign working with UPP to promote safety in the workplace, we were thrilled to launch the follow-up: a year-long campaign promoting employee health. As UPP employ over 800 people around the UK, the second year of the wellbeing campaign focuses on their health, be that physical, mental or workplace-related.</p>

    <h3> Improving health step-by-step</h3>
    <p>UPP asked us to find an engaging and lighthearted way to encourage their employees to take the first steps towards improving their mental, physical and workplace health.</p>
    <p>We used juxtaposed scenarios to highlight the change that UPP are encouraging is – in contrast to the surreal, parallel scene – modest and achievable. Working with illustrator Son of Alan, we created a playful look-and-feel based on retro instructional graphics.</p>
         
     <img width="100%" src="/images/UPP-WB-Health-Launch-Posters.jpg">
       <p>The use of How-To Guide styling highlights that we are not asking anything that is impossible – and that the simplest things can make a big difference. We are acknowledging that things can feel overwhelming, and that demonstrating that it’s just about taking things one step at a time.</p>
