    <h2>Macmillan - Gift in wills campaign</h2>
    <p>After the success Hatched had working with Macmillan on their Brave the Shave campaign, we were delighted to have the opportunity to work with them again to create a campaign for legacies.</p>
    <p>With gifts left in people’s wills accounting for one third of their annual income, creating a meaningful and engaging campaign that would connect with the audience was essential to the continued work that Macmillan does to support those living with cancer.</p>
    <h3>Making the TV advert</h3>
    <style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/0KGsn11xYbk' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
    <p>Working from the proposition of ‘life after life’, we focused on showing a view of people affected by cancer living their lives the way they want to – made possible by gifts in wills left to Macmillan.</p>
    <p>Motifs of the wider picture, connections and that of times where older generations are passing down knowledge to younger ones combine to show that by leaving a gift to Macmillan in your will, you are becoming part of a wider human tapestry and affecting lives far into the future.</p>

    <h3>From glossies to broadsheets</h3>
    <p>Our national print campaign took the creative from the TV advert and showed it at its essence – the moments made possible by gifts left in wills, and the headline ‘Where there’s a will there’s a way’.</p>
    <p>We chose four hero ads from the photography captured alongside the video footage, focusing on how support from Macmillan helps people to manage their worries and enjoy their lives.</p>
    <p>The art direction for the shoot focused on capturing people in their natural environments and in context – we wanted to show real relationships and the small moments which add up to a well-lived life.</p>
    <p>Working within Macmillan’s new brand guidelines, we created warm, straightforward and engaging adverts for publications ranging from The Times and The Daily Telegraph to The Big Issue and Sainsburys Magazine.</p>

    <h3>Welcome letter</h3>
    <p>When people are first considering whether to leave a gift in their will, and get in touch with Macmillan, the first point of contact they have is a welcome letter.</p>
    <p>As the prospect of considering, and taking those practical first steps towards, writing your will can be rather intimidating, we wanted to ensure the letter was reassuring, warm and left the decision very much in the reader’s hands.</p>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p>My role in this project included pitching for the campaign, honing new copy, working within Macmillan’s brand guidelines and working with my creative director and a copy-writer to concept and script a TV advert, design print materials, art direct video and photo shoots and design and artwork the press campaign.</p>
    <p>Together we created a campaign that puts positivity and hope at the heart of Macmillan’s legacy messaging, which was seen all across the UK. Our TV advert reached an audience of hundreds of thousands, broadcasting on channels ranging from SKY to ITV and Channel 4 and our print ads were featured in 17 national publications.</p>
