    <h1>Designers and the planet</h1>
    <small>November 6, 2018</small>
    <p>As designers, it can sometimes be hard not to feel at odds with the environment. A lot of what designers and advertisers do is create and shape desires - whether it's the product designer working on the next iPhone to keep the economy rolling along, to the advertiser enticing the public to feel dissatisfied with what they've already got - and the more people desire, the more devastating their impact on the planet.</p>
    <img src="/images/feature+image.jpg">
    <p>Therefore, I thought it would be interesting to take a look at just a few of the many ways that designers are making a positive environmental impact on society and on the planet.</p>
    <p>A question that came to mind was whether it was design’s job to take the pain out of people’s attempts to lower their environmental impact - or even better, to guide people there effortlessly, such as quietly replacing plastic straws with seaweed <a href="https://www.loliware.com/">ones</a>.</p>
    <img src="/images/Lolistraws.jpg">
    <p>Whilst policy can alter behaviours by creating monetary incentives, such as the astonishing effect that the 5p bag charge has had in reducing the number of plastic bags used by by 80%, design is tackling the issue by offering people alternatives which mean they need not even lower their consumption to lower their effect on the planet.</p>
    <p>A really exciting new field is biodegradable packaging. Whether it’s created from mould or algae, the adoption of this by big manufacturers could save millions of tonnes of plastic from entering the ecosystem each year.</p>
    <p>Over the pond in New York, the design studio Crème have been busy creating water vessels out of gourds, grown in moulds so they create uniform cups and jugs:</p>
    <p>"[We] identified gourds as a fast-growing plant that bears robust fruits each season, developing a strong outer skin, and fibery inner flesh. Once dried, gourds have traditionally been used by ancestors as receptacles like cups. Crème explored this centuries-old craft, using moulds to grow gourds into functional shapes, such as cups and flasks to create sustainable, renewable, and compostable products without waste."</p>
